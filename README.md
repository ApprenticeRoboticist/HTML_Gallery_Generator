## HTML Photogallery Generator
Simple Python desktop app I developed in order to shorten and automate creation of robot assembly instructions. </br> 

### History
During my work as Lego Mindstorms instructor one of my resposibilities was invention of new robot projects and then making its step by step assembly instructions. An instruction consists of many photos divided by sections called 'steps' and has to be in HTML format so it can be opened and displayed from a browser. Creating one manually required a lot of monotonous file renaming and copying-and-pasting inside HTML file and took around 20 to 30 minutes based on amount of photos and committed typos. As a sworn enemy of dull and repetitive yet possible-to-be-automated work, I decided to call on my Python skills to invent faster and less troublesome way of creating robot assembly instructions.

### Things I learned
This was my first serious python project which allowed me to practise such things as:
- working with standard library;
- making operations on lists;
- making operations on external files with use of 'os' module;
- catching and handling exceptions;
- creating GUI with Tkinter module;
- object oriented programming;

## Usage

You can start the app by copying the source code and running it with IDE. 
Requirements:
1. Python 3 (developed with 3.7 version)
2. Tkinter, os and time python libraries installed (should be pre-installed with Python)

Follow the steps from top to bottom.
