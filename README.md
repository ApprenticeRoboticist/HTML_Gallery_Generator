## HTML Photogallery Generator
Simple Python desktop app I developed in order to shorten and automate creation of robot assembly instructions. During my work as Lego Mindstorms instructor one of my resposibilities was creating lesson scenarios which included invention of new robot and then making a step by step assembly instruction. An instruction consists of many photos divided by sections called 'steps' and has to be in HTML format.
